## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, depending on the severity.
If this is a game breaking exploit which allows unauthorized access or op. Then it's critical, and should be reported by either sending me an email at `fx.e.morin@gmail.com`
or sending me a dm on discord at `FX#8959`

Otherwise you can either make an issue on github or join my discord at: https://discord.gg/mezndgtD83 in the #carpetfixes-dev channel

Usually these issues will be fixed within 1-4 days depending on how busy I am. Although for more critical issues, they can be fixed within a couple hours.
